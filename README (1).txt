To make a project in Linux, go into the terminal and tye the command "gedit" followed by the name 
you want to give the document. Since the given code is written in C++, make sure the name of the file 
is followed by ".cpp". Copy and paste the given code into the document that appeared and hit save. If
the code needs to be accessed again, use the same gedit command as before. To run the code, write in
the terminal "g++" followed by the name of the file followed by "-o" followed by the nickname you want to
give the file. Run this command, then the file will be loaded. To have the code actually run, the next
command in the terminal should be ./Whatever-nickname-you-gave-file and this will allow the user to 
interact with the paging model.

The code is all random and doesn't require any user input. One of the only thing that could be changed
changing the amount of frames the physical memory has. To change this, go to line ___ and change the
integer. The other thing that can be changed are the 4 byte words, which can be changed in line ____,
which has the array of words used.

Specific Directions:
To run the code exactly as we did within our document.
Download the Paging.cpp code and the text file. 
Make sure both the Paging.cpp and the text file are in the same directory.

Open up the terminal and type cd "directory Paging.cpp and the textfile are in"
Then enter the following command: g++ Paging.cpp -o Paging
After the code compiles, execute it by entering: ./Paging
Open up the text file, you may have a prompt that says the text file has been changed click reload to allow this change made by our code.
Repeat the execution step for multiple executions.
